# Fancy-Buttons

Practices with creating buttons that will change their state when we interact with them.

Each button will have a specific behavior:

The counter button will keep track how many times we click on it.
The angry button will change colour to get more red until it reaches a maximum threshold.
The light switch button will turn on and off when clicked.
The text repeater button will copy the text of the button over and over.

## Getting Started
